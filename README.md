# CS3503 – Assignments 1 & 2: Data Representation Fundamentals + Advanced Representations

## Overview
Assignment 1 was my very first time writing more than a tiny program in C. The goal there was to implement number base conversions (two different algorithms) and a bit-manipulation table printer.  

Assignment 2 builds on that same foundation, but cranks it up a notch. Instead of just two conversion algorithms, I had to implement six new functions covering octal/hex/binary conversions and signed integer representations (sign-magnitude, one’s complement, two’s complement).  

By this point, I was a lot more comfortable with C than when I started A1, but I still hit some roadblocks. Figuring out exactly how to format outputs to match the test file was tricky again, and the signed representations made me slow down and sketch things out by hand. Still, once I got it working, everything passed the test file cases and output looked right.

## Files in This Repository
- **`convert.c`**  
  Contains my implementations of:
  - From Assignment 1:  
    - `div_convert` → base conversion using division/remainder  
    - `sub_convert` → base conversion using subtraction of powers  
    - `print_tables` → prints three formatted lines (original, left-shifted by 3, and masked with 0xFF)  
  - From Assignment 2:  
    - `oct_to_bin` → direct 3-bit octal to binary mapping  
    - `oct_to_hex` → octal to hexadecimal conversion  
    - `hex_to_bin` → direct 4-bit hex to binary mapping  
    - `to_sign_magnitude` → signed integer representation  
    - `to_ones_complement` → one’s complement representation  
    - `to_twos_complement` → two’s complement representation  

- **`main.c`**  
  The test driver program. Reused from A1 but updated to handle the A2 functions. Reads test cases from the provided test file, calls the conversion/representation functions, and writes results to `output.txt`.

- **`A1_tests.txt`** / **`A2_tests.txt`**  
  Test files provided in D2L and Github. My program uses these as inputs depending on the assignment.

- **`output.txt`**  
  The output file generated by my program after running the test cases. Includes PASS/FAIL lines for conversions/representations and formatted lines for `print_tables`.

## How to Build
On my Mac, I compiled using GCC:

    gcc -Wall -Wextra -O2 -o convert main.c convert.c

---

## How to Run
Once compiled, run it with the provided test file. For example:

    ./convert A2_tests.txt

This will generate an `output.txt` file with all the results.

## Reflections

**What I learned:**  
- How to manually work through base conversions and signed number representations, then translate that into working code.  
- The importance of exact formatting (spacing, uppercase hex, etc.) when matching an assignment spec.  
- How to commit and push files into a GitHub repo for submission. By A2, pushing updates was way smoother than the repo setup I struggled with in A1.  

**What I struggled with:**  
- The subtraction-of-powers algorithm in A1 — I had to trace several examples on paper before it clicked.  
- The signed number representation functions in A2 (especially one’s vs. two’s complement). I had to slow down and carefully sketch examples before coding.  
- Getting my program to write `output.txt` in exactly the format the grader would check.  
- At first, I wasn’t sure if A2 meant creating a whole new repo/project or just updating A1, but I eventually realized it builds directly on A1.  

Overall, I feel much more confident in C after these first two assignments. A1 felt overwhelming at first, but now after A2 I can see how these concepts tie directly into computer organization. It’s still lower-level than what I’m used to (coming from Java), but I’m starting to appreciate the control you get by working this close to the machine.

## Acknowledgments / AI Tool Usage
I did get some debugging help and syntax clarifications from AI tools (ChatGPT), but I always double-checked, tested, and made sure I understood the code myself before submitting.
