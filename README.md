# CS3503 – Assignment 1: Data Representation Fundamentals

## Overview
This was the very first assignment in Computer Organization & Architecture, and also one of my first times writing more than a tiny program in C. The goal was to implement number base conversions (two different algorithms) and a bit-manipulation table printer.  

At first I wasn’t even sure how to set up the project in VS Code or how to get GCC working on my Mac, so I spent a lot of time just figuring out the tooling. Once I got that down, I worked through the algorithms step by step. Some parts clicked right away (like the division/remainder method), while others (like the subtraction-of-powers algorithm) took me longer to wrap my head around.

In the end, I got my code compiling, running, and producing the `output.txt` file with passing results. I know my solution might look a little more structured than a “first attempt,” but that’s because I spent a while testing and tweaking it until the results matched exactly what the test file expected.

## Files in This Repository
- **`convert.c`**  
  Contains my implementations of:
  - `div_convert` → base conversion using division/remainder  
  - `sub_convert` → base conversion using subtraction of powers  
  - `print_tables` → prints three formatted lines (original, left-shifted by 3, and masked with 0xFF)  

- **`main.c`**  
  The test driver program. Reads test cases from `A1_tests.txt`, calls the conversion/printing functions, and writes results to `output.txt`.

- **`A1_tests.txt`**  
  The test file provided in D2L. My program uses this as input.

- **`output.txt`**  
  The output file generated by my program after running all the test cases. Includes PASS/FAIL lines for conversion functions and the formatted lines for `print_tables`.

## How to Run
Once compiled, run it with the provided test file:

./convert A1_tests.txt

## Reflections

**What I learned:**
- How to manually work through base conversions and translate that into working code.  
- The importance of exact formatting (spacing, uppercase hex, etc.) when matching an assignment spec.  
- How to commit and push files into a GitHub repo for submission.  

**What I struggled with:**
- Understanding the subtraction-of-powers algorithm — I had to trace several examples on paper before it clicked.  
- Getting my program to write the `output.txt` file in the exact way the assignment expected.  
- GitHub setup in VS Code took longer than expected, but I figured it out eventually.  

**Where I might lose points:**
- My `main.c` is maybe more detailed than needed (like checking two possible filenames).  
- If there are any hidden formatting rules I missed, I could lose a few points there.  

Overall, I feel much more confident in C after this assignment than I did before starting it.

## Acknowledgments / AI Tool Usage
I received some assistance from AI tools (ChatGPT) for debugging help and clarifying syntax while I was stuck.  
However, I reviewed and tested everything myself and made sure I understood how my code works before submitting.
